Racing Game 2

To just download the game, go to the release tab and download the Racing-Game-2.zip. Unzip it, open the Release folder and run Racing.exe (I promise it's not a virus).

To see the code, download the repository, navigate to contrib, bin, then copy the 3 .dll files, navigate back to the root (where the Racing.sln file is) and paste the files in there. You should now be able to run the Racing.sln file in Visual Studio to see the source code.

I am a second year Games Software Engineering student. This is purely a project to help my C++ coding. It is a predecessor to Racing Game which was made in my first year using sdl. If you find this and want to reach out for whatever reason you can find me on Instagram @jamescomer03
